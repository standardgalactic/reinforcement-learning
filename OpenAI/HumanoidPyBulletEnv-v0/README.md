# Humanoid Walker Problem

### Getting Started
The environment to the Humanoid is described [here](https://github.com/benelot/pybullet-gym/blob/master/README.md).  

### Solution Video
[![HumanoidPyBulletEnv-v0](http://img.youtube.com/vi/dxZP1icxsMw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxZP1icxsMw "BipedalWalker-v3")

The video shows in the first part the behaviour of the untrained agent and then in comparison the behaviour of the trained agent.

### Solution Info
My learning algorithm is a [Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO)]([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf]).

### Instructions

start Jupyter Notebook `HumanoidPyBulletEnv-v0.ipynb` and follow the instructions.
