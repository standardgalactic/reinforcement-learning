# BipedalWalker Problem

### Getting Started
The environment to the BipedalWalker is described [here](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/BipedalWalker-v2).  

### Solution Video
[![BipedalWalker-v3](http://img.youtube.com/vi/14yGAsIG-Rs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14yGAsIG-Rs "BipedalWalker-v3")

The video shows in the first part the behaviour of the untrained agent and then in comparison the behaviour of the trained agent.

### Solution Info
My learning algorithm is a [Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (TD3)]([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09477.pdf]).

### Instructions

start Jupyter Notebook `BipedalWalker-v3.ipynb` and follow the instructions.
