# BipedalWalker Problem

### Getting Started
The environment to the BipedalWalker is described [here](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/BipedalWalker-v2).  
The environment to the Pendulum is described [here](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Pendulum-v0).


### Solution Video (from BipedalWalker-v2 Version)
[![BipedalWalker-v2](http://img.youtube.com/vi/QW6fWP5FDoU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QW6fWP5FDoU "BipedalWalker-v2")

The video shows in the first part the behaviour of the untrained agent and then in comparison the behaviour of the trained agent.

### Solution Info
My learning algorithm is a [Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (TD3)]([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09477.pdf]).

### Instructions

start Jupyter Notebook `BipedalWalker-v3.ipynb` and follow the instructions.
